# Overview

To further my learning I spent a lot of time in the oast few weeks working on learning how to code better with Java. I learned a lot about the language and how to use it.

The program that asks the user for an input of different genres of movies that they likes and outputs different movies that the user could watch!

I wrote this software so that I can have a program that I can modify and add more movies/genres to so that when I am looking for a movie to watch I can find one quickly. I also want to be able to modify it more in the future so it works better and is a lot longer. I think that I also would want to modify it to have more things like ratings, actors, and music that is in the film.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment
I used Java to create my program and the Java.util library.

# Useful Websites
- IMdb (https://www.imdb.com/?ref_=nv_home)
- W3schools (https://www.w3schools.com/java/)

# Future Work

- Add in ratings
- Add in actors
- Add in famous music as an option
